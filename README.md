In the next post I describe the development of a C++ to Python interface for a rigid body dynamic simulation which makes use of the NVIDIAÂ® PhysX SDK 4.1 engine.


PhysX represents a rigid euclidean transform as a quaternion and a position vector. Through the interface, after each time step all this information allocated in C++ is accessible in Python via Numpy arrays.



The interface is implemented through swig, a software tool that connects programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages.
